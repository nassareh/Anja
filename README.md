# Coastal Change Analysis

This Jupyter Notebook is dedicated to analyzing coastal changes using spatial and temporal data. The notebook focuses on regridding techniques and data analysis methods necessary for studying the impacts of environmental factors on coastal regions.

## Project Overview
The aim of this notebook is to provide tools and methods to analyze changes in coastal regions over time. Using a variety of data sources, the notebook processes, regrids, and analyzes data to track and predict changes in coastal landscapes.

## Features
- **Data Loading**: Load spatial data from multiple sources.
- **Data Processing**: Techniques for cleaning and preparing data for analysis.
- **Regridding Data**: Standardize data into a common spatial grid for comparison and analysis.
- **Visualization**: Generate visual representations of coastal changes over time.
- **Predictive Analysis**: Employ statistical tools to predict future changes.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
